1. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
In the first problem, we had to define the string. Then return it with a string function "sorted" so it's in alphabetical order. After that, to be 
able to display it, print the function.

def alphabet_soup(str):               #defining str
    return "".join(sorted(str))       #return the string with the sorted function so it's sorted in alphabetical order

print (alphabet_soup("hello"))        #display
print (alphabet_soup("hacker"))

2. EMOTICON PROBLEM
In the second problem, create a function by first of all defining emotify. Then, by using "e.replace", a string function. We can replace the initial 
string 1 with string 2. So if we display a phrase containing string 1, it will instead show string 2.

def emotify(e):                       #defining e
    e = e.replace("smile", ":)")      #using a string function to change string1 to string2
    e = e.replace("grin", ":D")
    e = e.replace("sad", ":(")
    e = e.replace("mad", ">:(")
    return e

print(emotify("Make me smile"))      #display
print(emotify("I am mad"))
print(emotify("What a grin"))
print(emotify("I am so sad"))

3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
In the third problem, a list must be created first. It contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The output should display the "first" containing the first element, 
the "middle" in which between the first and last elements is shown, and lastly the "last" would just be the last element. For the function, we must define 
the element in the list. The first element will always be '0'. Then, for the middle, to show the elements between the first and last. The input value is 1, 
which is the second element, where the middle would start. After that, a colon is put to slice the list, then put the last element after it. Because you're 
slicing the middle to the element. For the last is -1 corresponding to the last element. Now you can print and run the code.

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]               #list
first = [lst[0]]                       #first will be equal to '0' because it corresponds to the first elemen,t which is 1
middle = lst[1:-1]                     #second will be equal to 1: -1 because it is sliced from the list which is 1 the second element and -1 as the last element
last = [lst[-1]]                       #last corresponds to -1 because it is the last element which is 6

print("first:", first)                 #Display
print("middle:", middle)
print("last:", last)
